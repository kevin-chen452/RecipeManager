# Block Breaker Blast!

## Project Proposal

This application will launch a game, where people control a paddle to bounce a ball off of, and this ball
will bounce around and break blocks that appear. There will be different features and modes that can be 
customized and chosen by the user to change things up, as it will likely become repetitive if there is only 
one mode to play the game in.

There are many audiences in mind, but generally. I think that these people will use it:
- people who enjoy video games
- people who need some **fun** in their boring lives
- people needing a break from the reality that is life
- myself

This project is of interest to me, because I personally fit all four of the criteria mentioned above. In addition
to that, I think block breaker games have been a bit forgotten nowadays, which is sad, because I loved playing them
as a kid. So I want to relive my childhood to an extent, by making a block breaker game myself, and making it shine.
