# Recipe Manager

## Kevin Chen

This application will launch an application that allows the user to keep track of their recipes. They will be able to 
do things such as adding and removing recipes, viewing their current recipes, and much more. 

There are many audiences in mind, but generally. I think that these people will use it:
- people who enjoy cooking
- people who have friends or family that enjoy cooking
- **myself**

This project is of interest to me, because I personally fit all of the criteria mentioned above. In addition
to that, I think it will be really nice to have a recipe manager right here on my desktop. As well, by making this
application myself, this means I can customize it to my needs, and potentially add new features in the long term,
beyond these two months.
