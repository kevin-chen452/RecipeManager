# Block Breaker Blast!

## Kevin Chen

This application will launch a game where people control a paddle to bounce a ball off of, and this ball
will bounce around and break blocks that appear. When playing this game, various tips and life advice will be displayed
to the user, most often before and after a game. 

There are many audiences in mind, but generally. I think that these people will use it:
- people who enjoy video games
- people who need some **fun** in their boring lives
- people needing a break from the reality that is life
- myself

This project is of interest to me, because I personally fit all four of the criteria mentioned above. In addition
to that, I think block breaker games have been a bit forgotten nowadays, which is sad, because I loved playing them
as a kid. So I want to relive my childhood to an extent, by making a block breaker game myself, and making it shine.
